## Introduction

In this repository, you will find my solutions to LeetCode problems. Each problem solution is organized into its directory and includes the problem statement, my approach, and the implementation in a specific programming language.

LeetCode is a popular platform that offers a wide range of coding problems, including algorithmic challenges, data structure problems, and system design questions. The problems are categorized based on their difficulty level and cover various topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, and more.

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference or learning resource. However, I encourage you to try solving the problems yourself before referring to the solutions. Solving coding problems is an excellent way to improve your problem-solving skills and enhance your understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
├── problem-1
│ ├── problem-1.md
│ ├── solution.cpp
├── problem-2
│ ├── problem-2.md
│ ├── solution.cpp
└── ...

Each problem has its own directory named `problem-n` (where `n` represents the problem number). Inside each problem directory, you will find the following files:

- `problem-n.md`: This markdown file contains the problem statement, input/output examples, and any additional explanations or constraints.
- `solution.cpp`: The solution implementation in C++.

Note that not all problems will have solutions in all programming languages. The available programming languages may vary depending on my preference or the requirements of the problem.

## Languages

The solutions in this repository are implemented in C++. I chose this language as that is widely used and has good support for algorithmic problem-solving. However, depending on the problem or my personal preference, you may find solutions in other languages as well.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, you can:

- Add solutions to new LeetCode problems that are not already included.
- Improve existing solutions by optimizing the code or providing alternative approaches.
- Add test cases or additional explanations to existing solutions.

To contribute, simply fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. I appreciate any contributions and will review them as soon as possible.
